# Japanese Learning Progress Tracker

This is a personal web application I developed to track and visualize my Japanese language learning progress. Designed to keep myself motivated, it combines data from multiple language-learning platforms through APIs and web scraping, presenting insights and trends in an intuitive, visual format.

The application is built with a **React frontend** and a **Python backend**, deployed on a Linux server under my own domain.

## Features

### **Progress Tracking**
- Total vocabulary known.
- Total days Japanese is actively studied.
- Current streak of consecutive study days.
- Consistency percentage (days studied vs. total days since beginning).

### **Visualizations**
- A GitHub-inspired heatmap showing daily study activity over the years.
- Graphs for:
  - Total vocabulary growth over time.
  - Vocabulary learned per week.
  - Vocabulary distribution by memory level.
  - Retention rates for new and known vocabulary.
    
## Purpose

This app is solely for personal use, designed to provide daily motivation and actionable insights into my language-learning progress. It helps me stay consistent and focused on my goals.

# Japanese Learning Progress Tracker

This is a personal web application I developed to track and visualize my Japanese language learning progress. Designed to keep myself motivated, it combines data from multiple language-learning platforms through APIs and web scraping, presenting insights and trends in an intuitive, visual format.

The application is built with a **React frontend** and a **Python backend**, deployed on a Linux server under my own domain.

## Features

### **Progress Tracking**
- Total vocabulary known.
- Total days Japanese is actively studied.
- Current streak of consecutive study days.
- Consistency percentage (days studied vs. total days since beginning).

### **Visualizations**
- A GitHub-inspired heatmap showing daily study activity over the years.
- Graphs for:
  - Total vocabulary growth over time.
  - Vocabulary learned per week.
  - Vocabulary distribution by memory level.
  - Retention rates for new and known vocabulary.
    
## Purpose

This app is solely for personal use, designed to provide daily motivation and actionable insights into my language-learning progress. It helps me stay consistent and focused on my goals.

## End Goal

The end goal of this project is to create a comprehensive tool for tracking all aspects of my Japanese learning journey. Planned features include:
- **Additional Visualizations:**
  - Track "leeches" (words I frequently forget) over time.
  - Visualize abandoned vocabulary over time.
- **Focused Review Tools:**
  - Identify leeches and export them for targeted review.
  - View the review history of individual words.
- **Interactive Heatmap:**
  - Click on any day to see new words learned that day and old words failed during review.
- **Grammar Progress Tracking:**
  - Connect to Bunpro to track grammar progress across all JLPT levels.
- **Kanji Knowledge Tracking:**
  - Use known vocabulary to extrapolate which kanji I can read. This can be visualized in a 'map'


## Current Stage

I work on this project whenever I get the chance, gradually adding features and improving functionality as time permits.
